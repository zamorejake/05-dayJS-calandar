## JavaScript Calendar/05-challenge

## Description
In this project I had to debug a calendar program. I had to use tools like JQuery and DayJS to help me complete this task. 

## Visuals

## Usage/Link
In this program it is supposed to save whatever is typed into each hour block into local storage and displayed if the user ever refreshes the page. Along with this the color of each block is supposed to change based on the current hour.
Here is a link to the working project: https://zamorejake.github.io/05-dayJS-calendar/

## Support
For help leave a comment on the github!

## Roadmap
In the future I plan to add months and years, I would like to make this my main calendar so adding a backend instead of saving to local storage would be cool.
